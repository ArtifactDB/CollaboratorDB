# JSON schemas for CollaboratorDB

This repository contains JSON schemas for CollaboratorDB,
our database for sharing datasets and results between Genentech scientists and external collaborators.
Schemas here are derived from the [**BiocObjectSchemas**](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/BiocObjectSchemas) repository,
with a modest amount of additional metadata to describe each resource.
